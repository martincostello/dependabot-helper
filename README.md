# Dependabot Helper

[![Build status](https://github.com/martincostello/dependabot-helper/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/martincostello/dependabot-helper/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild+branch%3Amain+event%3Apush)

## Introduction

Dependabot Helper is an ASP.NET Core application that helps manage Dependabot updates across GitHub multiple repositories.

For more information, refer to the [documentation](./documentation/docs#readme).

## Debugging

To debug the application locally outside of the integration tests, you will need
to [create a GitHub OAuth app] to obtain secrets for the `GitHub:ClientId` and
`GitHub:ClientSecret` [options] so that the [OAuth user authentication] works and
you can log into the Dependabot Helper UI. GitHub Enterprise Server is also supported.

> üí° When creating the GitHub OAuth app, use `https://localhost:5001/sign-in-github`
as the _Authorization callback URL_.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit GitHub OAuth secrets to source control. Configure them
with [User Secrets] instead.

## Building and Testing

[.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download "Download the .NET SDK")
to be installed.

following set of commands:

```powershell
