## Introduction

_Dependabot Helper_ is an ASP.NET Core application that helps manage [Dependabot]
updates across GitHub multiple repositories.

[Dependabot]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates

Dependabot Helper integrates with the [GitHub API] via [OAuth] to interact with
selected repositories acting as your user account to manage pull requests
generated by bots, such as the [dependabot bot] and the [github-actions bot].

[dependabot bot]: https://github.com/apps/dependabot
[github-actions bot]: https://github.com/apps/github-actions
[GitHub API]: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api
[OAuth]: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps

For more information, please refer to the [documentation].

## Debugging

To debug the application locally outside of the integration tests, you will need
to [create a GitHub OAuth app] to obtain secrets for the `GitHub:ClientId` and
`GitHub:ClientSecret` [options] so that the [OAuth user authentication] works and
you can log into the Dependabot Helper UI. GitHub Enterprise Server is also supported.

> üí° When creating the GitHub OAuth app, use `https://localhost:5001/sign-in-github`
as the _Authorization callback URL_.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit GitHub OAuth secrets to source control. Configure them
with [User Secrets] instead.

## Building and Testing
